                    <p> I dont know when it happened but somehwere between random talks and quiet momments you became a part of my everyday thoughts. It's weird how someone can feel like home without even trying, when my head is loud thinking about you makes it softer. <br> <br> i'm not perfect, i overthink, i disappear without any notice, i care too much about little things but with you i don't feel like pretending, i can be myself. i don't need big moments with you, even small things hit hard, a reply, a smile, a vn it stays longer than it should. i dunno how can i fix everything, i dunno how can things become like they used to be. i'm not trying to prove any point here, BUT if you're reading this i just wanted to tell you that a parrt of my hearrt STILL trusts you. <br> <br> And honestly if someday you wonder whether you mattered??? YOU DIDDD, YOU STILLLLLL DO MORE THAN YOU PROLLY REALIZE IT  </p>

                    <p>There aint enough worrds that can tell you the exact reason of loving you i dunno how to decribe this but since i made this section i have to write. Something about you is different not by physical appearance but the way you talk, the way you listen without judging, the way you care about yourself without thinking what other ppl might think about that. i love your vibe, i wish if i could stay with you forever. <br> <br> You dont try too hard to be funny, you make ppl around yourself laugh naturally. you're not someone i like but someone i admire, respect. Maybe you dont see it it but the way you are, meant a lot to me. I wanted to tell you these things by myself but no one knew that it'd become too late to say that. i know its too CRINGEEE but some feelings are meant to be said even if they're cringe.</p>
